## 4.2 Service Value System
The ITIL service value system (SVS) describes how all the components and activities of the organization work together, as a system, to enable value creation.

SVS ensures that the organization continually co-creates value with all stakeholders, through the use of products and services.

The components, activities, and organization's resources can be configured in multiple combinations. This requires the coordination of activities and practices of all parties, to be truly effective.

The key input to the SVS system is the Opportunity/Demand: 
- Opportunities represent the possibilities of adding value to stakeholders, or improving the organization. 
- Demand is the need or desire for products and services.

The outcome of SVS is value: The perceived benefits/usefulness/importance of something. The SVS can enable the creation of different types of value for a wide group of stakeholders. 

Opportunity and demand trigger activities within the ITIL SVS, that lead to value creation.

Opportunities can trigger work within the system, even when there is no demand. 

Organizations should prioritize new/changed services with opportunities for improvement, to ensure their resources are correctly allocated.

## 4.3 Components of SVS
- Guiding principles: Guide an organization in all circumstances.
- Governance: The means by which an organization is directed and controlled.
- Service value chain: A set of interconnected activities that an organization performs to deliver a valuable product.
- Practices: A set of organizational resources designed for performing work.
- Continual improvement: A recurring organizational activity performed at all levels.

## 4.4 Organizational Silos
Organizational silos are a challenge to organizations. It occurs when there is:
- Resistance to change
- Difficulty in accessing information and specialized expertise
- Reduced efficiency that increases both cost and risk
- Difficulty in communication/collaboration

A siloed organization:
- Cannot act quickly to take advantage of opportunities
- Are unable to make effective decisions about changes
- Can cause organizational practices to become silos

The ITIL SVS has been specifically designed to enable flexibility, and discourage siloed working.

Organizations should be able to define/redefine their value streams in a flexible, yet safe and efficient manner.

The ITIL guiding principles guide the overall improvement of the organization.

The guiding principles create a foundation for a shared culture across the organization, that discourages silos.

The ITIL SVS supports many work approaches with a flexible value-oriented operating model, such as Agile, DevOps, and Lean, etc. 

## 4.5 ITIL Guiding Principles
A guiding principle is a recommendation that guides an organization in all circumstances: 
- The guiding principles help organizations adopt and adapt ITIL guidance to their specific needs.
- They help to integrate multiple methods into an overall approach to service management.
- They are universally applicable to all initiatives.
- They encourage and support continual improvement at all levels.

These principles are:
- Focus on value
- Start where you are
- Progress iteratively with feedback
- Collaborate and promote visibility
- Think and work holistically
- Keep it simple and practical
- Optimize and automate

## 4.6 Focus on Value
The organization should create value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders.

1. Identify the service consumer
2. Know the consumer's perspective of value
3. Map value to the intended outcomes that change over time
4. Know the customer experience (CX) or the user experience (UX)

## 4.7 Applying the Principle - Focus on Value
1. Know how service consumers use each service.
2. Encourage a focus on value among all staff.
3. Focus on value during operational activities and improvement initiatives.
4. Focus on the value in every step of the improvement initiative.

## 4.8 Start Where You Are
Before starting an improvement initiative, consider what is already available to be leveraged.

- Decisions should be based on accurate information obtained through direct observation and appropriate measurement.
- Obtaining data from the source avoids assumptions that can have a negative impact on the budget and timeline.

Measurement should be used to support the analysis of what has been observed.
