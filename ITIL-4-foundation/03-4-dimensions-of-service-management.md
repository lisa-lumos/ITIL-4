## 3.2 Dimensions of Service Management
ITIL defines 4 dimensions, that are critical to the effective and efficient facilitation of value to customers and other stakeholders:
1. Organizations and people
2. Information and technology
3. Partners and suppliers
4. Values streams and processes

They represent perspectives relevant to the "service value system" (SVS).

They are constrained by several external factors, that are beyond the control of the SVS.

They must be addressed by the organizations to meet the expectations of quality or efficiency.

The four dimensions do not have sharp boundaries and may overlap.

## 3.3 Organizations and People
It covers:
- Formal organizational structure
- Roles and responsibilities
- Staffing and competencies
- Culture

An organization should ensure that its structure and management is well-defined, and supports its overall strategy and operating model.

A leader advocates values that help and motivate people, to work in desirable ways.

Creates shared values and attitudes; Promotes a culture of trust and transparency; Facilitates communication. 

Key elements of people:
- customers
- employees of suppliers
- employees of the service provicer
- other stakeholder in the service relationship

People: Update skills and competencies; Interface between specializations and roles; Communication and collaboration; Levels of collaboration and coordination; Management and leadership styles; Broad knowledge and deep specialization. 
 
## 3.4 Information and Technology
It applies both to service management, and the services being managed.

When applied to the SVS, the information and technology dimension includes:
- Information and knowledge
- Technologies
- Relationships between the components

Technologies supporting service management: Workflow management, Knowledge bases, Communication systems, Analytical tools, Remote collaboration, Inventory systems, Artificial intelligence, Mobile platforms, Cloud solutions, Machine learning

Technologies supporting IT servicesZ: IT architecture, Databases, Blockchain, Cognitive computing, Applications, Communication systems, Artificial intelligence, Cloud computing, Mobile applications

Information management is the primary means of delivering customer value.

Information criteria: Availability, Reliability, Accessibility, Timeliness, Accuracy, Relevance

The information and technology dimension focuses on the challenges of information management, such as security and regulatory compliance requirements.

## 3.5 Information and Technology Regulations
Organizations must consider how information is exchanged, between different services and service components.

An organization may be subject to the European Union's GDPR, which influences its information management policies and practices.

Other industries may have regulations, that impose constraints on the collection and management of data.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 provides data privacy and security provisions, for safeguarding medical information in the US.

## 3.6 Selecting the Right Technology

Information technology considerations: 
- Is it compatible with the current architecture?
- Does the organization have the right skills to support and maintain it?
- Does it raise any regulatory, compliance, or information security control issues?
- Does it have sufficient automation capabilities to be developed, deployed, and
- operated?
- Will it continue to be viable in the foreseeable future?
- Does it have additional capabilities that can be leveraged for other products or
- services?
- Does it align with the service provider or service consumer strategy?
- Does it introduce new risks or constraints to the organization?

## 3.7 Factors Influencing Technology
Culture
- Some organizations are more interested than others, in being technologically advanced.
- Other organizations focus on a more traditional way of working.

Nature of the business
- A company with government clients may have restrictions, on the use of some technologies.
- Industries, such as finance or life sciences, cannot use open source and public services.

## 3.8 Cloud Computing
It is a model, for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, that can be rapidly provided with minimal management effort, or provider interaction. 

ITSM focuses on value for customers, and this focus is technology-agnostic: what matters is not the technology, but the opportunities it creates for the customers. 

As cloud computing has become an architectural shift in IT, organizations have to react to it in ways that are most beneficial for themselves, their customers, and other stakeholders. 

Key characteristics of cloud computing:
- On-demand availability
- Network access
- Resource pooling
- Rapid elasticity
- Measured service

## 3.9 Partners and Suppliers
Every organization and service depends on services provided by other organizations, to some extent.

Service partnerships; Goods and service supply. 

The partners and suppliers dimension encompasses an organization's relationships with other organizations.

An organization can use the service integration and management method, to address the partners and suppliers' dimension.

A specially established integrator ensures that service relationships are properly coordinated.

Relationships between organizations may involve various levels of integration and formality. This ranges from contracts with clear separation of responsibilities, to flexible partnerships, where parties share common goals and risks, and collaborate to achieve desired outcomes. 

## 3.10 Organization Strategy
An organization's strategy for choosing partners and suppliers, should be based on its goals, culture, and business environment.

Factors Influencing Organizational Strategy:
- Cost concerns
- Resource scarcity
- Subject matter expertise
- Corporate culture
- External constraints
- Strategic focus
- Organizational Strategy
- Demand patterns

## 3.11 Value Streams and Processes
The fourth dimension of service management, is value streams and processes. They define the activities, workflows, controls, and procedures to achieve the agreed objectives.

It is concerned with how the various parts of the organization work, in an integrated and coordinated way, to enable value creation through products and services.

It focuses on:
- What activities the organization undertakes
- How activities are organized
- How value creation is ensured to all stakeholders efficiently and effectively

A value stream is a series of steps an organization undertakes to create and deliver products and services to consumers. It combines the organization's value chain activities.

Benefits of Value Streams:
- Value stream provides a clear picture of what an organization delivers, and how to make continual improvements to its services.
- An organization can map their work with the identified value stream map, to analyze their current state, and identify barriers and non-value adding activities.
- Opportunities to increase value-adding activities can be found across the service value chain.
- Value stream optimization includes process automation or adoption of emerging technologies to gain efficiencies or enhance user experience.
- Value streams can be redefined to react to changing demands, or remain stable for a significant amount of time.

## 3.12 Processes
A process is a set of interrelated activities that transform inputs into outputs. Processes define the sequence of activities and their dependencies.

A well-defined process can improve productivity within and across organizations.

An organization should answer the following questions, to successfully create, deliver, and improve a service:
- What is the generic delivery model for the service, and how does the service work?
- What are the value streams involved in delivering the agreed outputs of the service?
- Who performs the required service actions?

## 3.13 Factors Affecting Service Providers
Service providers are affected by external factors, that exhibit high degrees of volatility and impose constraints.

Collectively, these factors influence how organizations configure their resources and address the four dimensions of service management.

External Factors: PESTLE
- Political: Laws, regulations, policies, bureaucracy, corruption, trade unions, import/export restrictions. Can also comprise laws around data protections, consumer protection, copyright, patent, and intellectual property. 
- Economic: consumer income, monetary and fiscal policies, stock market trends, interest rates, economic growth, labor costs. 
- Social: Consumer lifestyles and buying habits, attitudes and expectations of product and service quality, and societal makeup. 
- Technological: Considerations around available private and public infrastructure, rate of technology change, level of technology adoption, internet penetration, and adoption of smartphones. 
- Legal: laws around antitrust, copyright, consumer protection, employment, health and safety, and data protection. 
- Environmental: weather, climate change, pollution, laws designed to regulate/tackle pollution and wast management, attitudes from business and consumers toward renewable energy, and environmentally friendly products and services.
