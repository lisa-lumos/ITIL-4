## 2.2 Service Management
Service management is a set of specialized organizational capabilities, that enable value to customers in the form of services.

To develop the specialized organizational capabilities, you must understand:
- Nature of value
- Nature/scope of the stakeholders involved
- Value creation enablement through services

The purpose of an organization is to create value for stakeholders. 

Value: the perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something. 

Value is co-created through an active collaboration, between providers and consumers. 

Service providers: Organizations that deliver services. 

service consumers: Those receiving services. 

## 2.3 Stakeholders of Service Management
In service management, there are different kinds of stakeholders, that need to be understood in the context of value creation, in the form of services. 

Organizations, Service providers, Service consumers, Other stakeholders. 

Organizations: A person or a group of people, with its own functions and objectives. 

Service providers: A provider, who sells services in the open market to other businesses, and individual consumers. 

Service consumers: A generic role, that simplifies the definition/description of service relationships structure. 

Other stakeholders: Other stakeholders, apart from service providers and consumers, who are important for value creation. 

## 2.4 Service Consumer Roles
In practice, there are more specific roles involved in service consumption, such as customers, users, sponsors. These roles can be separate or combined. 

Customer: The role that defines the requirements of a service, and takes responsibility for the outcome of service consumption. 

User: A role that uses services. 

Sponsor: A role that authorizes budget for service consumption. 

Example 1: A company wishing to purchase mobile phone services for its employees, from a wireless carrier. 
- Customer: The Chief Information Officer (CIO) and key communication team members fill in the role of the customer, when they analyze the mobile communication requirements of the company's employees, negotiate the contract with the wireless carrier, and monitor the carrier's performance against the contracted requirements.
- User: The employees (including the CIO, CFO, and communications team members) fill the role of users when they order/receive/use the mobile phone services, as per the agreed contract.
- Sponsor: The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) fills the role of the sponsor when they review the proposed service arrangement, and approve the cost of the contract as negotiated.

Example 2: As an individual private consumer of the same wireless carrier,  simultaneously acts as a user, customer, and sponsor.

It is important to identify these roles in service relationships, to ensure effective communication and stakeholder management. Each of these roles may have different, or even conflicting, expectations from services and different definitions of value.

Other Stakeholder Roles: Individual employees of the provider organization, Investors and shareholders, Partners and suppliers, Government organizations and social groups. 

Products and services create value for stakeholders in many ways, Some values are direct, such as revenue generation, while other are indirect, such as employee experience. 

| Stakeholders | Examples of value for stakeholders |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Service consumers | Achieved benefits, optimized costs and risks |
| Service provider | Funding from the consumer, business development, and image improvement |
| Service provider employees | Financial and non-financial incentives, career and professional development, and a sense of purpose |
| Society and community | Employment, taxes, and organizations' contribution to the development of the community |
| Charity organizations | Financial and non-financial contributions from other organizations |
| Shareholders | Financial benefits such as dividends, and a sense of assurance and stability |

## 2.5 Products and Services
Product: A configuration of an organization's resources, designed to offer value to consumers. It is complex, and not entirely visible to the consumer. Organizations tailor products to suit their consumer groups.

Service: It co-creates value, by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without having to manage specific costs and risks. It is the central component of service management. It is based on one or more products.

## 2.6 Service Offerings
Service offering: The description of one/more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. It includes goods, access to resources, and service actions.

Service providers present their services to consumers in the form of service offerings.

| Component | Description | Examples |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Goods | Supplied to the consumer; Ownership is transferred to the consumer; Consumer takes responsibility for future use | A mobile phone; A physical server | 
| Access to resources |  Ownership is not transferred to the consumer; Access is granted to the consumer under agreed terms and conditions; The consumer can only access the resources during the agreed consumption period |  Access to a mobile network or to a network storage |
| Service actions | Performed by the service provider to address a consumer's needs; Performed according to an agreement with the consumer | User support; Replacement of a piece of equipment |

Services are offered to target consumer groups. These groups may be either internal, or external to the service provider organization.

Different offerings can be created based on the same product. Thus, the same product can be used in multiple ways, to address the needs of different consumer groups.

For example, a software service can be offered as a limited free version, or as a comprehensive paid version, based on one product of the service provider.

## 2.7 Service Relationships
Service relationships: the cooperation between service providers and service consumers. They are established between two or more organizations, to co-create value.

In a service relationship, organizations take the roles of service providers or service consumers.

Organizations provide and consume a number of services at any given time.

A service relationship includes:
- Service provision: activities performed by an organization to provide services. It includes: Management of provider resources; Provision of user access to resources; Fulfillment of the agreed service actions; Service performance management and continual improvement; Supplying of goods. 
- Service consumption: activities performed by an organization to consume services. It includes: Management of the consumer's resources; Utilization of the provider's resources; Requesting of service actions to be fulfilled; Receiving or acquiring goods
- Service relationship management: joint activities performed by service providers and service consumers to ensure continual value co-creation.

Service providers create new resources, or modify existing resources, for service consumers. For example: 
- A training service improves the skills of the consumer's employees.
- A broadband service allows the consumer's computers to communicate.
- A car-hire service enables the consumer's staff to visit clients.
- A software development service creates a new application for the service consumer.

The service consumer can use its new or modified resources to create its own products, and address the needs of another target consumer group, thus becoming a service provider.

## 2.8 Value Outcomes, Costs, and Risks Service Relationships
Service providers help their consumers to achieve outcomes, and take on some of the associated risks and costs.

Service relationships can introduce new risks and costs, and can negatively affect some of the intended outcomes, while supporting others.

Service relationships are perceived as valuable, only when they have more positive effects, then negative ones.

service provider organization produces outputs, that help its consumers to achieve certain outcomes.

Output: A tangible/intangible deliverable of an activity

Outcome: A result for a stakeholder, enabled by one or more outputs

Cost: The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource. It can be expressed in non-monetary terms, such as time spent, people allocated, etc.

2 types of costs involved in service relationships: 
1. Costs removed from the consumer by the service - may include technology, cost of staff, etc. Consumer may not need to provide, such as when they hire contractors. 
2. Costs imposed on the consumer by the service (the cost of service consumption). Includes the cost charged by the service provider, if applicable, plus, costs such as staff training, network usage, procurement, etc. 

It is important to understand both types of cost, to ensure that the correct decisions are made, regarding the service relationship.

## 2.9 Risks
Risk is a possible event, that could cause harm or loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives. It can be used in the context of measuring the probability of positive outcomes, as well as negative outcomes.

2 types of risks involved in service relationships: 
1. Risks removed from a consumer by the service. These removed risks can be: failure of the consumer's server hardware; Lack of staff availability. 
2. Risks imposed on a consumer by the service. An example would be: Service provider ceasing to trade; Experiencing a security breach. 

A service provider should manage the detailed level of risk, on behalf of the consumer.

The consumer contributes to the reduction of risk through:
- Actively participation, in the definition of the requirements of the service, and the clarification of its required outcomes
- Clearly communicating the critical success factors (CSFs) and constraints, that apply to the service
- Ensuring the provider has access to the necessary resources of the consumer, throughout the service relationship

## 2.10 Utility and Warranty
Asses the overall utility and warranty of the service, to evaluate whether a service, or service offering, will facilitate the outcomes desired by the consumers, and therefore create value for them.

Utility: The functionality offered by a product/service, to meet a particular need.

Warranty: An assurance, that a product/service will meet the agreed requirements.


Utility: 
- "what the service does"
- Determines whether a service is "fit for purpose"
- A service must either support the performance of the consumer, or remove constraints from the consumer to have utility

Warranty: 
- "how the service performs"
- Determines whether a service is "fit for use"
- Relates to service levels, aligned with the needs of service consumers (maybe based on a formal agreement, marketing message, brand image, etc)

They are essential for a service to facilitate its desired outcomes and therefore help create value.

Example 1: A recreational theme park may offer exciting rides to deliver thrilling experiences for park visitors (utility). If a significant number of the rides are unavailable due to mechanical difficulties, the park is not fulfilling the warranty (it is not fit for use). Therefore, the consumers will not receive their expected value.

Example 2: The rides are always up and running during advertised hours, but they do not have features that provide the levels of excitement expected by visitors. The utility is not fulfilled, even though the warranty is sufficient. Consumers would not receive the expected value.

## 2.11 Key Takeaways
Service management supports the organizational shift, and leverages opportunities from new technologies.

Value is co-created, through an active collaboration between providers and consumers, as well as other organizations, that are a part of the relevant service relationships.

The most important stakeholders of ITSM include organizations, service providers, service consumers, and other stakeholders.

Service is a means of enabling value co-creation, by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.

Service offering is a description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group.

Service relationship is defined as the cooperation between a service provider and a service consumer.

Service providers help their consumers to achieve outcomes, and in doing so, take on some of the associated risks and costs.

Utility is the functionality offered by a product or service, to meet a particular need. Warranty is defined as an assurance, that a product or service will meet the agreed requirements.
