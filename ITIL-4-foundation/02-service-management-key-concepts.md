## 2.2 Service Management
Service management is a set of specialized organizational capabilities, that enable value to customers in the form of services.

To develop the specialized organizational capabilities, you must understand:
- Nature of value
- Nature/scope of the stakeholders involved
- Value creation enablement through services

The purpose of an organization is to create value for stakeholders. 

Value: the perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something. 

Value is co-created through an active collaboration, between providers and consumers. 

Service providers: Organizations that deliver services. 

service consumers: Those receiving services. 

## 2.3 Stakeholders of Service Management
In service management, there are different kinds of stakeholders, that need to be understood in the context of value creation, in the form of services. 

Organizations, Service providers, Service consumers, Other stakeholders. 

Organizations: A person or a group of people, with its own functions and objectives. 

Service providers: A provider, who sells services in the open market to other businesses, and individual consumers. 

Service consumers: A generic role, that simplifies the definition/description of service relationships structure. 

Other stakeholders: Other stakeholders, apart from service providers and consumers, who are important for value creation. 

## 2.4 Service Consumer Roles
In practice, there are more specific roles involved in service consumption, such as customers, users, sponsors. These roles can be separate or combined. 

Customer: The role that defines the requirements of a service, and takes responsibility for the outcome of service consumption. 

User: A role that uses services. 

Sponsor: A role that authorizes budget for service consumption. 

Example 1: A company wishing to purchase mobile phone services for its employees, from a wireless carrier. 
- Customer: The Chief Information Officer (CIO) and key communication team members fill in the role of the customer, when they analyze the mobile communication requirements of the company's employees, negotiate the contract with the wireless carrier, and monitor the carrier's performance against the contracted requirements.
- User: The employees (including the CIO, CFO, and communications team members) fill the role of users when they order/receive/use the mobile phone services, as per the agreed contract.
- Sponsor: The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) fills the role of the sponsor when they review the proposed service arrangement, and approve the cost of the contract as negotiated.

Example 2: As an individual private consumer of the same wireless carrier,  simultaneously acts as a user, customer, and sponsor.

It is important to identify these roles in service relationships, to ensure effective communication and stakeholder management. Each of these roles may have different, or even conflicting, expectations from services and different definitions of value.

Other Stakeholder Roles: Individual employees of the provider organization, Investors and shareholders, Partners and suppliers, Government organizations and social groups. 

Products and services create value for stakeholders in many ways, Some values are direct, such as revenue generation, while other are indirect, such as employee experience. 

| Stakeholders | Examples of value for stakeholders |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Service consumers | Achieved benefits, optimized costs and risks |
| Service provider | Funding from the consumer, business development, and image improvement |
| Service provider employees | Financial and non-financial incentives, career and professional development, and a sense of purpose |
| Society and community | Employment, taxes, and organizations' contribution to the development of the community |
| Charity organizations | Financial and non-financial contributions from other organizations |
| Shareholders | Financial benefits such as dividends, and a sense of assurance and stability |

## 2.5 Products and Services
Product: A configuration of an organization's resources, designed to offer value to consumers. It is complex, and not entirely visible to the consumer. Organizations tailor products to suit their consumer groups.

Service: It co-creates value, by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without having to manage specific costs and risks. It is the central component of service management. It is based on one or more products.

## 2.6 Service Offerings
Service offering: The description of one/more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. It includes goods, access to resources, and service actions.

Service providers present their services to consumers in the form of service offerings.

| Component | Description | Examples |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Goods | Supplied to the consumer; Ownership is transferred to the consumer; Consumer takes responsibility for future use | A mobile phone; A physical server | 
| Access to resources |  Ownership is not transferred to the consumer; Access is granted to the consumer under agreed terms and conditions; The consumer can only access the resources during the agreed consumption period |  Access to a mobile network or to a network storage |
| Service actions | Performed by the service provider to address a consumer's needs; Performed according to an agreement with the consumer | User support; Replacement of a piece of equipment |

Services are offered to target consumer groups. These groups may be either internal, or external to the service provider organization.

Different offerings can be created based on the same product. Thus, the same product can be used in multiple ways, to address the needs of different consumer groups.

For example, a software service can be offered as a limited free version, or as a comprehensive paid version, based on one product of the service provider.

## 2.7 Service Relationships
Service relationships: the cooperation between service providers and service consumers. They are established between two or more organizations, to co-create value.

In a service relationship, organizations take the roles of service providers or service consumers.

Organizations provide and consume a number of services at any given time.

A service relationship includes:
- Service provision: activities performed by an organization to provide services. It includes: Management of provider resources; Provision of user access to resources; Fulfillment of the agreed service actions; Service performance management and continual improvement; Supplying of goods. 
- Service consumption: activities performed by an organization to consume services. It includes: Management of the consumer's resources; Utilization of the provider's resources; Requesting of service actions to be fulfilled; Receiving or acquiring goods
- Service relationship management: joint activities performed by service providers and service consumers to ensure continual value co-creation.

Service providers create new resources, or modify existing resources, for service consumers. For example: 
- A training service improves the skills of the consumer's employees.
- A broadband service allows the consumer's computers to communicate.
- A car-hire service enables the consumer's staff to visit clients.
- A software development service creates a new application for the service consumer.

The service consumer can use its new or modified resources to create its own products, and address the needs of another target consumer group, thus becoming a service provider.
