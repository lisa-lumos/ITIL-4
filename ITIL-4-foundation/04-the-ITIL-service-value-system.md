skipped

## 4.2 Service Value System
The ITIL service value system (SVS) describes how all the components and activities of the organization work together, as a system, to enable value creation.

SVS ensures that the organization continually co-creates value with all stakeholders, through the use of products and services.

The components, activities, and organization's resources can be configured in multiple combinations. This requires the coordination of activities and practices of all parties, to be truly effective.

The key input to the SVS system is the Opportunity/Demand: 
- Opportunities represent the possibilities of adding value to stakeholders, or improving the organization. 
- Demand is the need or desire for products and services.

The outcome of SVS is value: The perceived benefits/usefulness/importance of something. The SVS can enable the creation of different types of value for a wide group of stakeholders. 

Opportunity and demand trigger activities within the ITIL SVS, that lead to value creation.

Opportunities can trigger work within the system, even when there is no demand. 

Organizations should prioritize new/changed services with opportunities for improvement, to ensure their resources are correctly allocated.

## 4.3 Components of SVS
- Guiding principles: Guide an organization in all circumstances.
- Governance: The means by which an organization is directed and controlled.
- Service value chain: A set of interconnected activities that an organization performs to deliver a valuable product.
- Practices: A set of organizational resources designed for performing work.
- Continual improvement: A recurring organizational activity performed at all levels.

## 4.4 Organizational Silos
Organizational silos are a challenge to organizations. It occurs when there is:
- Resistance to change
- Difficulty in accessing information and specialized expertise
- Reduced efficiency that increases both cost and risk
- Difficulty in communication/collaboration

A siloed organization:
- Cannot act quickly to take advantage of opportunities
- Are unable to make effective decisions about changes
- Can cause organizational practices to become silos

The ITIL SVS has been specifically designed to enable flexibility, and discourage siloed working.

Organizations should be able to define/redefine their value streams in a flexible, yet safe and efficient manner.

The ITIL guiding principles guide the overall improvement of the organization.

The guiding principles create a foundation for a shared culture across the organization, that discourages silos.

The ITIL SVS supports many work approaches with a flexible value-oriented operating model, such as Agile, DevOps, and Lean, etc. 

## 4.5 ITIL Guiding Principles
A guiding principle is a recommendation that guides an organization in all circumstances: 
- The guiding principles help organizations adopt and adapt ITIL guidance to their specific needs.
- They help to integrate multiple methods into an overall approach to service management.
- They are universally applicable to all initiatives.
- They encourage and support continual improvement at all levels.

These principles are:
- Focus on value
- Start where you are
- Progress iteratively with feedback
- Collaborate and promote visibility
- Think and work holistically
- Keep it simple and practical
- Optimize and automate

## 4.6 Focus on Value
The organization should create value for itself, its customers, and other stakeholders.

1. Identify the service consumer
2. Know the consumer's perspective of value
3. Map value to the intended outcomes that change over time
4. Know the customer experience (CX) or the user experience (UX)

## 4.7 Applying the Principle - Focus on Value
1. Know how service consumers use each service.
2. Encourage a focus on value among all staff.
3. Focus on value during operational activities and improvement initiatives.
4. Focus on the value in every step of the improvement initiative.

## 4.8 Start Where You Are
Before starting an improvement initiative, consider what is already available to be leveraged.

- Decisions should be based on accurate information obtained through direct observation and appropriate measurement.
- Obtaining data from the source avoids assumptions that can have a negative impact on the budget and timeline.

Measurement should be used to support the analysis of what has been observed.

## 4.9 Applying the Principle - Start Where You Are
- Look at what already exists.
- Determine if successful practices or services can be replicated.
- Apply risk management skills in the decision-making process. 
- Recognize that sometimes nothing from the current state can be reused.

## 4.10 Progress Iteratively with Feedback
Organize work into small, manageable sections to execute them in a timely manner.
- Improvement iterations can be sequential or simultaneous.
- Individual iterations should be managed.
- The need of an iteration may be altered or even eliminated.
- Seeking feedback before, during, and after each iteration will ensure that actions are focused and appropriate.

A feedback loop is a situation where part of the output is used for a new input. Well-constructed feedback mechanisms facilitate understanding of the:
- End user and customer perception of the value created
- Efficiency and effectiveness of value chain activities
- Effectiveness of service governance and management controls
- Interfaces between the organization and its partner and supplier network
- Demand for products and services

## 4.11 Applying the Principle - Progress Iteratively with Feedback
- Understand the big picture, but ensure steady progress.
- Receive feedback at all times for a constantly changing ecosystem.
- Fast doesn't mean incomplete. Use minimum viable product.

## 4.12 Collaborate and Promote Visibility
Right people in the right role ensures more buy-in, more relevance and increased likelihood of long-term success.
- DevOps includes driving factors like recognizing needs for genuine collaboration
- Agile, lean, and other ITSM frameworks will not work without effective collaboration.
- It is important to identify and manage all stakeholder groups.

A stakeholder is anyone who has a stake in the organization's activities.

Stakeholder collaboration includes:
- Developers working with other internal teams
- Suppliers collaborating with the organization
- Relationship managers collaborating with service consumers
- Customers collaborating with each other
- Internal and external suppliers collaborating with each other

Poor visibility of work affects decision-making, and impacts the organization's ability to improve internal capabilities. So they need to:
- Understand the flow of work in progress
- Identify bottlenecks and excess capacity
- Uncover waste

## 4.13 Applying the Principle - Collaborate and Promote Visibility
Collaboration does not mean consensus. 

Communicate in a way the audience can hear. 

Decisions can only be made on visible data. 

## 4.14 Think and Work Holistically
A holistic approach to service management requires an understanding of how all the parts of an organization work together. It requires an end-to-end visibility of how demand is captured and translated into outcomes.

## 4.15 Applying the Principle - Think and Work Holistically
- Recognize the complexity of the systems. 
- Remember that collaboration is key to thinking and working holistically.
- Look for patterns in the needs and interactions between system elements.
- Remember that automation can facilitate working

## 4.16 Keep It Simple and Practical
Outcome-based thinking should be used to produce practical solutions that deliver
valuable outcomes.
- Use the minimum number of steps to accomplish an objective.
- Ensure that actions contribute to value creation.
- Start with an uncomplicated approach and then add controls, activities, or metrics when needed.
- Be mindful of competing objectives.

## 4.17 Applying the Principle - Keep It Simple and Practical
1. Every activity should create value.
2. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
3. Do fewer things, but do them better.
4. Respect the time of the people involved.
5. Simple practices are easier to understand and follow.
6. Quick wins allow organizations to demonstrate progress, and manage stakeholder expectations. 

## 4.18 Optimize and Automate
Optimization refers to the action of making something effective and useful.
- Understand and agree to the context in which the proposed optimization exists.
- Assess the current state of the proposed optimization.
- Agree to what the future state and priorities of the organization should be.
- Ensure the optimization has the appropriate level of stakeholder engagement and commitment.
- Execute the improvements in an iterative way.
- Continually monitor the impact of optimization.

Automation is the use of technology to perform a step or series of steps correctly and consistently, with limited or no human intervention.

- Automating frequent and repetitive tasks helps organizations scale up and allows human resources to be used for complex decision-making.
- The simplest form of automation involves standardizing and streamlining manual tasks to allow decisions to be made automatically

## 4.19 Applying the Principle - Optimize and Automate
Simplify and optimize before automating. 

Define your metrics.

When optimizing and automating, consider the following guiding principles:
- Progress iteratively with feedback
- Keep it simple and practical
- Focus on value
- Start where you are

## 4.20 Principle Interaction
- Ensure that the principles interact with and are dependant on each other.
- Consider the relevance of each principle and how they apply together.

Governance is realized through the following activities:
1. Evaluate. The governing body evaluates the organization on a regular basis as stakeholders' needs and external circumstances evolve.
2. Direct. The governing body assigns responsibility for, and directs the preparation and implementation of, organizational strategy and policies. 
3. Monitor. The governing body monitors the performance of the organization and its practices, products, and services. 

The governing body needs to make sure that:
- The service value chain and the organization's practices work in line with the direction given by the governing body.
- The governing body of the organization maintains oversight of the SVS.
- Both the governing body and management at all levels maintain alignment through a clear set of shared principles and objectives.
- The governance and management at all levels are continually improved to meet expectations of the stakeholders.
